The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:

 1. Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt from the d/loaded folders and store them in data variables.
 2. Read X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt from the d/loaded folders and store them in Label variables.
 3. Read X_subject.txt, y_subject.txt and subject_test.txt from the d/loaded folders and store them in subject variables.
 4. Concatenate testData to trainData and save to variable. 
 5. Concatenate testLabel to trainLabel and save to variable.
 6. Concatenate testSubject to trainSubject and save to variable.
 7. Read the features.txt file from the d/loaded folders store the data in a variable called features. 
 8. We only extract the by selecting mean and standard deviation. 
 9. Subset of to join data with the 66 corresponding columns.
10. Read the activity_labels.txt file from the d/loaded folder and store to variable.
11. Combine the labels to the data set in the first column.
12. Write the cleanedData out to "merged_data.txt" file in current working directory.
